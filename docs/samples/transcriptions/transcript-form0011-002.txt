James Carter recently joined DataTech Solutions as an administrative assistant at 500 L Street NW, Washington, D.C., 20005. He began his new role on March 1, 2025, working full-time with a 40-hour schedule from Monday to Friday. His hourly wage is $25.50. His authorization number for employment is 87456-DC.

Living in Arlington, Virginia, James relies on the Washington Metro for his daily commute, as he does not own a car and his workplace does not offer private parking. His work hours are from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and he is not required to work evenings or weekends.

His benefits package includes paid sick leave, medical and dental insurance, and employee discounts at affiliated gyms and retail stores. Additionally, the company provides free meals at the office cafeteria, allowing him to save on food expenses.

James works in a modern, open-office environment where he regularly interacts with colleagues and clients. His workload is generally manageable but can become more demanding during high-pressure periods. While he has shown strong punctuality and organization, his supervisor, Emily Richards, noted that he could improve in multitasking and prioritizing tasks more efficiently.

To enhance his performance, James will take training in task management and workflow automation tools. With support from his colleagues, he aims to improve his efficiency and work toward future career growth within DataTech Solutions.

His employment is supported by CareerPath Workforce Services, which acts as his provider. His progress is monitored through a quarterly reporting period. Additionally, he receives guidance from his assigned VR specialist, Michael Thompson, who provides career development support.
