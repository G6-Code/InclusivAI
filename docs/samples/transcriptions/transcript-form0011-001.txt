Mateo Ramírez just started a new job as an administrative assistant at Tech Solutions Inc., located at 1100 K Street NW, Washington, D.C. His first day of work was April 1, 2024, and his contract establishes a 40-hour workweek, working Monday through Friday with a salary of $24.00 per hour.

To commute to work, Mateo uses the Washington Metro, as he lives in an apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland, and does not own a car. He does not have private parking at the office, so he relies entirely on public transportation. His schedule is daytime, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and he is not required to work weekends or night shifts.

As part of his benefits package, Mateo has access to sick leave, medical and dental insurance, as well as employee discounts at gyms and associated stores. Additionally, the company offers free meals in the building's cafeteria, allowing him to save on food during the workweek.

His work environment is a modern and accessible office, with a moderate level of social contact, as he needs to interact with clients and colleagues from different departments. His workload is light to moderate, and most of his tasks are performed in a shared office space with access to meeting rooms. Occasionally, the work pace can become more dynamic as deadlines approach, although it generally remains stable.

After his first month, his supervisor, Laura Gómez, evaluated his performance as satisfactory. He has shown punctuality and organization, but needs improvement in managing multiple tasks simultaneously. As a result, he has been recommended to take additional training in time management and productivity tools.

The next step in his development within the company will be to attend these trainings and receive support from his colleagues to improve his efficiency in assigned tasks. Over time, he hopes to advance within the company and take advantage of all the professional growth opportunities that Tech Solutions Inc. offers him.
